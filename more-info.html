Your Snowflake user does not have the required permissions for your Precog data
pipeline to load data into your database. This can be resolved by following
these steps, replacing with a password. Instructions Feel free to adapt these to
your internal processes and preferences using the steps below as a guide. Please
note however that the permissions detailed below are required for the user's
default role. 1) Log into Snowflake at https://app.snowflake.com/. 2) Select
“Classic Console” from the menu on the left. 3) You may be asked to sign in
again at this point. 4) Select “Worksheets” from the toolbar at the top.\n 5)
Paste the following into a new worksheet:\n \n CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE
precog;\n CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE precog;\n CREATE OR REPLACE SCHEMA precog;\n
CREATE WAREHOUSE precog WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL' WAREHOUSE_TYPE =
'STANDARD' AUTO_SUSPEND = 300 AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;\n GRANT ALL ON WAREHOUSE
precog TO ROLE precog;\n GRANT ALL ON DATABASE precog TO ROLE precog;\n GRANT
ALL ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE precog TO ROLE precog;\n CREATE OR REPLACE USER
precog PASSWORD = LOGIN_NAME = precog DISPLAY_NAME = precog MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD
= FALSE DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = precog; GRANT ROLE precog TO USER precog; ALTER USER
precog SET default_role=precog; GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE precog TO
ROLE precog; GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE precog TO ROLE precog;
GRANT ROLE precog TO ROLE sysadmin; 6) Enable the “All queries” checkbox. 7)
Click “Run”. You now have a database, warehouse, and user named precog with the
password. Return to your Precog data pipeline and click "Edit destination".
Change the username, warehouse and database to precog. Change the password to
the password you specified in the prior steps. Click "Save" then try again.
